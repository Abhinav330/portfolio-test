[Albert Einstein](/portfolio-test/images/albert_bhai.jpg){: .align-right width= "300px"}

📍 Based in London, UK 🇬🇧  

🧠 Albert Einstein once said, _**“If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.”**_ I firmly believe in this. AI is not just about algorithms; it’s about solving real-world business problems.   

💡 **That’s why I love consulting!**  
I bridge the gap between AI and business, ensuring that cutting-edge models are not just built—but actually drive impact.

🚀 I am a Data Scientist & AI Engineer, passionate about building intelligent systems and LLM-based AI agents.  

🎓 I recently completed MSc in Data Science & Analytics from University of Westminster. 

💡 My research interests include LLMs, Generative AI, and Machine Learning Deployment.  

🎖️ I am 3x Microsoft Certified.
