excerpt: 'Presently, wide adaptation of IoT in different areas of applications has gained extreme exposure. In the field of agriculture, the role of IoT is remarkably increasing in recent days. In this paper, a novel smart farming technique is introduced. Here, few crops, like tomato, mint, onion, and chickpea are considered for the experimental purpose, can be grown irrespective all seasons. In this paper, sensors are embedded in the lawn exploiting the data related to different environmental parameters and depending on the status of the obtained data it is operated in two modes manual mode and automatic mode, respectively. The uniqueness of this prototype is with inside the dual mode of operation of the device in concurrence with the cost analysis.'
