# My Story: A Journey of Dreams, Struggles, and Triumphs

## 🌍 Introduction: From a Small Town to the World

Hello everyone! This is my story—how a small-town boy from Bihar, India, made his way to London, UK. 

I won't bore you with stories about how I was a tiny baby weighing just 3 kg... bla bla... But what I will tell you is how life took me on a rollercoaster ride through more than 15 cities and two countries. 

Among all these places, **Ranchi, Jharkhand, India, is home.** A place filled with breathtaking waterfalls, serene mountains, and lush valleys. I could go on forever, but I'll just say—visit it once, and you'll know what I mean! 

## 🎒 Early Life: The Curious Kid

I did my schooling in Ranchi. I was **never a topper**—in fact, I barely passed my exams. If someone told my younger self that I would one day complete my Master’s with distinction, I would have laughed in disbelief. 

At 15, I discovered something that changed my life—**Arduino and Robotics.** My first project? A **Bluetooth Home Automation System.** It was the spark that ignited my passion for electronics. Even before this, I loved repairing fans, changing switches, and playing around with circuits since I was **just 10 years old.**

When I performed well in secondary school, I got to choose **Science** as my subject. But it was a complete accident that I stumbled upon **Computer Science** in higher secondary. That accident became **the turning point of my life.** Until then, coding was just a tool to make my robotic systems work. But now, it became **who I was.**

I **barely passed** my higher secondary exams, but despite that, I chose **Computer Science** for my Bachelor's—and that decision **changed everything.**

## 🎓 University Life: From Culture Shock to Innovation

I pursued my **B.Tech in Computer Science** in **Kolkata, India.** Moving from a small town to a metropolitan city was a **culture shock,** but I adapted quickly. 

In **my first year**, I got the chance to work as an **Automation Engineer for a Student Formula-1 Team.** I built gadgets for the F1 car—**a 360-degree radar, GPS-based locking system, G-force calculator,** and more. This was my **first taste of real-world engineering.** 

In **my second year**, I joined the **core robotics team.** With my knowledge and execution speed, I quickly became a **key member of multiple teams.** I built numerous innovative projects, presented them at **dozens of events,** and even **filed four patents.** 

🚀 My efforts led me to become the **President of a student chapter.** I worked hard to increase its popularity, helping many students develop their own projects. We even won **1st prize at the state level.** This was the start of **my consulting journey.** 

Then, COVID hit. **Everything was gone in an instant.**

But challenges bring opportunities. Since no one was delivering results during the pandemic, I stepped up. Soon, I was made the **Student Innovation Head** of my college, negotiating between students and decision-makers, working on projects, and driving innovation in uncertain times. 

## 💼 Job Life: From Intern to Consultant

In my **final year**, I was offered an **internship at Cognizant** with an extended job offer. I was made the **team leader, managing 35 interns.** Despite the challenges, we achieved a **99% conversion rate to full-time roles.** This was when I truly understood what **consulting** is all about—**finding a way to grow together.**

During the COVID period, I was introduced to **Machine Learning.** What started as curiosity became an obsession. I took courses, worked on self-projects, and eventually landed a role as a **Junior Data Scientist and Consultant** at Cognizant. 

I worked with a **European industry leader** and successfully delivered my project. But deep down, I knew I wanted more. I wanted to challenge myself, explore new horizons, and push my limits.

## ✈️ London Life: A Leap of Faith

I took the toughest decision of my life—**moving to a new country for my Master’s,** knowing that the job market was **unstable, even the worst in 50 years.**

My first international trip—**alone, no connections, no idea what to expect.** But one thing I can say—**London accepts you before you accept it.** 

Here, I pursued my **Master’s in Data Science and Analytics.** It was a life-changing experience. I met amazing friends from all over the world, experienced new cultures, and expanded my mindset in ways I never imagined. 

The biggest turning point? **Working on Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs).** Thanks to an internship at **ContractPodAI,** I deep-dived into AI. It influenced me so much that I dedicated my **Master’s dissertation to Generative AI.** 

Recently, I received my **unofficial marks—I graduated with distinction!** 🎉

## 🔍 Now: The Job Hunt Battle

And now, here I am. **Looking for a job in AI and Data Science.** 

**It’s tough.**

Resources are draining. Patience is fading. Some days, emotions take over. If I were a country, I’d declare an **emergency.**

But I believe—this is **war.** And in a war, you need just **one chance to prove yourself.**

That’s my story… so far. 🚀

The next chapter? **I’m writing it right now.**
